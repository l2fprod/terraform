```
resource "ibm_cis_origin_pool" "example" {
  cis_id = ibm_cis.instance.id
  name   = "example-pool"
  origins {
    name    = "example-1"
    address = "192.0.2.1"
    enabled = false
  }
  origins {
    name    = "example-2"
    address = "192.0.2.2"
    enabled = false
  }
  description        = "example load balancer pool"
  enabled            = false
  minimum_origins    = 1
  notification_email = "someone@example.com"
  check_regions      = ["WEU"]
}

### Input parameter 
{: #cis-origin-pool-input}

Review the input parameters that you can specify for your resource. 
{: shortdesc}

|Name|Data type|Required/ optional|Description|
|----|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
|`cis_id`|String|Required|The ID of the {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}} instance.|
|`name`|String|Required|A short name (tag) for the pool. Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.|
|`origins`|Array|Required|A list of origins within this pool. Traffic directed to this pool is balanced across all currently healthy origins, provided the pool itself is healthy. It’s a complex value. See description below.|
|`check_regions`|Array|Required| A list of regions (specified by region code) from which to run health checks. If the list is empty, all regions are included, but you must use the Enterprise plan. This is the default setting. Region codes can be found on the [Cloudflare’s website](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/#geo-steering-enterprise-plans-only){: external}.
|`description`|String|Optional|A description for your origin pool. | 
|`enabled`|Boolean|Required|If set to **true**, this pool is enabled and can receive incoming network traffic. Disabled pools do not receive network traffic and are excluded from health checks. Disabling a pool causes any load balancers that use the pool to failover to the next pool (if applicable).|
|`minimum_origins`|Integer|Optional| The minimum number of origins that must be healthy for this pool to serve traffic. If the number of healthy origins falls below this number, the pool will be marked unhealthy and we will failover to the next available pool. Default: 1.|
|`monitor`|String|Optional|The ID of the monitor to use for health checking origins within this pool.|
|`notification_email`|String|Optional|The email address to send health status notifications to. This can be an individual mailbox or a mailing list.|


### Output parameter
{: #cis-origin-pool-output}

Review the output parameters that you can access after your resource is created. 
{: shortdesc}

|Name|Data type|Description|
|----|-----------|--------|
|`id`|String| The ID of the origin pool. |
|`created_on`|String|The RFC3339 timestamp of when the origin pool was created. |
|`modified_on`|String|The RFC3339 timestamp of when the origin pool was last modified. |

### Import
{: #cis-origin-pool-import}

The origin pool can be imported by using the `id`. The ID is formed from the origin pool ID and the CRN (Cloud Resource Name). All values are concatenated with a `:` character.
The CRN can be located on the **Overview** page of the Internet Services instance under the **Domain** heading of the UI, or via using the `ibmcloud cis` CLI.

- **CRN**: The CRN is a 120 digit character string of the format `crn:v1:bluemix:public:internet-svcs:global:a/1aa1111a1a1111aa1a111111111111aa:11aa111a-11a1-1a11-111a-111aaa11a1a1::` 
- **Origin pool ID**: The origin pool ID is a 32 digit character string in the format 1aaaa111111aa11111111111a1a11a1. The ID of a origin pool is not available via the UI. It can be retrieved programmatically via the CIS API or via the CLI by running `ibmcloud cis glb-pools`.
